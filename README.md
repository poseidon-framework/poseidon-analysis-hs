Welcome to the poseidon-analysis-hs package.

This is under development currently. 

The binary `xerxes` is available for Mac OS X and Linux as precompiled binaries on [github](https://github.com/poseidon-framework/poseidon-analysis-hs/releases/latest)

To install the development version of poseidon-analysis-hs/xerxes you can follow these steps:

1. Install the Haskell build tool [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)
2. Clone this repository
3. Execute `stack install` inside the repository to build the tool and copy the executables to `~/.local/bin` (which you may want to add to your path). This will install the compiler and all dependencies into folders that won't interfere with any installation you might already have.

Documentation available on the [Poseidon Webpage](https://poseidon-framework.github.io/#/xerxes).
