  abstract = "Population mixture is an important process in biology. We present
              a suite of methods for learning about population mixtures,
              implemented in a software package called ADMIXTOOLS, that support
              formal tests for whether mixture occurred and make it possible to
              infer proportions and dates of mixture. We also describe the
              development of a new single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array
              consisting of 629,433 sites with clearly documented ascertainment
              that was specifically designed for population genetic analyses
              and that we genotyped in 934 individuals from 53 diverse
              populations. To illustrate the methods, we give a number of
              examples that provide new insights about the history of human
              admixture. The most striking finding is a clear signal of
              admixture into northern Europe, with one ancestral population
              related to present-day Basques and Sardinians and the other
              related to present-day populations of northeast Asia and the
              Americas. This likely reflects a history of admixture between
              Neolithic migrants and the indigenous Mesolithic population of
              Europe, consistent with recent analyses of ancient bones from
              Sweden and the sequencing of the genome of the Tyrolean
              ``Iceman.''",

  abstract  = "Many questions about human genetic history can be addressed by
               examining the patterns of shared genetic variation between sets
               of populations. A useful methodological framework for this
               purpose isF-statistics that measure shared genetic drift between
               sets of two, three, and four populations and can be used to test
               simple and complex hypotheses about admixture between
               populations. This article provides context from phylogenetic and
               population genetic theory. I review how F-statistics can be
               interpreted as branch lengths or paths and derive new
               interpretations, using coalescent theory. I further show that
               the admixture tests can be interpreted as testing general
               properties of phylogenies, allowing extension of some ideas
               applications to arbitrary phylogenetic trees. The new results
               are used to investigate the behavior of the statistics under
               different models of population structure and show how population
               substructure complicates inference. The results lead to
               simplified estimators in many cases, and I recommend to replace
               F3 with the average number of pairwise differences for
               estimating population divergence.",
