- 0.3.1.0: Switched to poseidon-hs v1.1.11.0, which includes better Plink input options.
- 0.3.0.0: A number of changes when integrating paagen into xerxes: 
	- Switched to GHC v8.10.7
	- Ran stylish-haskell and enabled a GitHub action that checks if new code follows its default guidelines
	- Added and endabled the subcommand admixpops (formerly part of the independent tool paagen)
	- Added the infrastructure for direct genotype data handling for admixpops (not yet for fstats and ras, though)
	- Added a normal code check GitHub Action to make sure the master branch compiles and the tests run through
	- Updated the colog logging to the new setup in poseidon-hs v1.1.1.0
	- Replaced some parsing code with a dependency to Poseidon.CLI.OptparseApplicativeParsers added in poseidon-hs v1.1.1.2
	- Integrated some of the error handling innovations (e.g. --logMode/--errLength) from trident in xerxes
